# Students-test-scores-VS-Working-Hours

This is the code for Linear Regression

## Overview

 I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. Intuitively, there must be a relationship right? The more you study, the better your test scores should be. We're going to use [linear regression](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/node/250) to prove this relationship. 

#### Sum of squared distances formula (to calculate our error)

#### Partial derivative with respect to b and m (to perform gradient descent)
